# -t is a tag for the image we are building and refer it later if we want to create a container with our image
# . means look in the current directory for a docker file & use that docker file to build the image
# reason is running on mac/win azure actually needs your container to be build using linux
# mainly buildx will emulate a linux environment when it builds your container

docker run -d --name language_translate-detect_fastapi-docker -p 80:80 language-translate-app

# run the container locally this is just for test eventual goal is to run the container in the cloud 
# using docker run to run the container -d means run it in daemon mode hence keep the container running in the background even if the terminal is closed
# --name is the name of the running container dlapi
# -p tells us to bind a port on our computer to a port in the docker container from the dockerfile -> CMD [ "uvicorn" , "main:app" , "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]
# port 80 inside our docker conatiner from the dockerfile -p flag is connecting port 80 inside the container to port 80 on our computer
# hence we can actually access the web server from our browser

docker stop language_translate-detect_fastapi-docker
#stop the container
